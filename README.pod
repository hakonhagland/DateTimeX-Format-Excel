DateTimeX::Format::Excel - Microsofty conversion of Excel epochs

=head1 SYNOPSIS
	
	#!perl
	use DateTimeX::Format::Excel;

	# From an Excel date number

	my	$parser = DateTimeX::Format::Excel->new();
	print	$parser->parse_datetime( 25569 )->ymd ."\n";
	my	$datetime = $parser->parse_datetime( 37680 );
	print	$datetime->ymd() ."\n";
		$datetime = $parser->parse_datetime( 40123.625 );
	print	$datetime->iso8601() ."\n";

	# And back to an Excel number from a DateTime object

	use DateTime;
	my	$dt = DateTime->new( year => 1979, month => 7, day => 16 );
	my	$daynum = $parser->format_datetime( $dt );
	print 	$daynum ."\n";

	my 	$dt_with_time = DateTime->new( year => 2010, month => 7, day => 23
									, hour => 18, minute => 20 );
	my 	$parser_date = $parser->format_datetime( $dt_with_time );
	print 	$parser_date ."\n";

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Excel uses a different system for its dates than most Unix programs.
This module allows you to convert between the Excel raw format and
and L<DateTime> objects, which can then be further converted via any
of the other L<DateTime::Format::*
|https://metacpan.org/search?q=DateTime%3A%3AFormat> modules, or just 
with L<DateTime>'s methods.  The L<DateTime::Format::Excel> module states 
"we assume what Psion assumed for their Abacus / Sheet program".  As a 
consequence the output does not follow exactly the output of Excel.  
Especially in the Windows range of 0-60.  This module attempts to more 
faithfully follow actual Microsoft Excel with a few notable exceptions.

Excel has a few date quirks. First, it allows two different epochs.  One 
for the Windows world and one for the Apple world.  The windows epoch 
starts in 0-January-1900 and allows for 29-February-1900 (both non real 
dates).  Most of the explanations for the difference between windows 
implementations and Apple implementations focus on the fact that there 
was no leap year in 1900 L<(the Gregorian vs Julian calendars)
|http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gregorian_calendar> and the Apple 
version wanted to skip that issue.  Both non real dates appear to have 
been a known issue in the original design of Lotus 1-2-3 that was carried 
over for L<compatibility|http://support.microsoft.com/kb/214326>.  I like 
to think that the original Lotus spreadsheet designer thought that 
non-programmers wouldn't want to count from 0 so January first was 
represented as 1.  This is never explicitly stated in any documentation I 
could find.  In any case by the time the apple version rolled out 
more code centric heads were in charge and the apple version starts 
1-January-1904. (counting from 0 while avoiding the leap year issue).  
In both cases the Windows and Apple version use integers from the epoch 
start to represent days and the decimal portion to represent a portion of 
a day.  Both Windows and Apple Excel will attempt to convert recognized date 
strings to an Excel epoch for storage with the exception that any date prior 
to the epoch start will be stored as a string.  (31-December-1899 and earlier 
for Windows and 31-December-1903 and earlier for Apple).  Next, Excel does 
not allow for a time zone component of each number. Finally, in the Windows 
version when dealing with epochs that do not have a date component just a 
time component all values will fall between 0 and 1 which is a non real date 
(0-January-1900).

=head2 Caveat utilitor

This explanation is not intended to justify Microsofts decisions with Excel 
dates just replicate them as faithfully as possible.  This module makes the 
assumption that you already know if your date is a string or a number in Excel 
and that you will handle string to DateTime conversions elsewhere. see 
L<DateTime::Format::Flexible>.  Any passed strings will die.  (As a failure 
of a L<Type::Tiny> test)  This module also makes several unilateral decisions 
to deal with corner cases.  When a 0 date is requested to be converted to 
DateTime it will use L<Carp> to cluck that it received a bad date and then 
provide a DateTime object dated 1-January-1900 (Excel would provide 
0-January-1900).  If a value between 0 and 1 is requested to be converted to 
a DateTime object the module will B<NOT> cluck and provide an object dated 
1-January-1900 with the appropriate time component. All Apple times are provide 
as 1-January-1904.  Any requested numerical conversion for Windows >= 60 and 
< 61 will cluck and provide a DateTime object dated 1-March-1900 (Excel would 
provide 29-Febrary-1900).  All requests for conversion of negative numbers to 
DateTime objects will die .  If a DateTime object is provided for conversion 
to the Excel value and it falls earlier than 1-January-1900 for Windows and 
1-January-1904 for Apple then the DateTime object itself will be returned.  
If you accept the output of that L<method|/format_datetime( $date_time )> 
as a scalar, DateTime will stringify itself and give you a text equivalent 
date.  For time zones you can L<pass|/parse_datetime( @arg_list )> a time zone 
with the excel number for conversion to the DateTime object.  In reverse, 
the conversion to Excel Epoch uses the L<-E<gt>jd
|https://metacpan.org/pod/DateTime#dt-jd-dt-mjd> method for calculation so 
the time zone is stripped out.  No clone or duration calculations are provided 
with this module.  Finally this is a L<Moose> based module and does 
not provide a functional interface. I<(Moose would allow it I just chose not 
to for design purposes)>.

The Types module for this package uses L<Type::Tiny> which can, in the background, 
use L<Type::Tiny::XS>.  While in general this is a good thing you will need to make 
sure that Type::Tiny::XS is version 0.010 or newer since the older ones didn't support 
the 'Optional' method.

=head2 Attributes

Data passed to new when creating an instance (parser).  For modification of 
these attributes see the listed L</Methods> of the instance.

=head3 system_type

=over

B<Definition:> This attribute identifies whether the translation will be done 
for Windows Excel => 'win_excel' or Apple Excel => 'apple_excel'.

B<Default> win_excel (0-January-1900T00:00:00 = 0, range includes 29-February-1900)

B<Range> win_excel|apple_excel (1-January-1904T00:00:00 = 0)

=head2 Methods

These include methods to adjust attributes as well as providing methods to 
provide the conversion functionality of the module.

=head3 get_system_type

=over

B<Definition:> This is the way to see whether the conversion is Windows or Apple based

B<Accepts:>Nothing

B<Returns:> win_excel|apple_excel

=back

=head3 set_system_type( $system )

=over

B<Definition:> This is the way to set the base epoch for the translator

B<Accepts:> win_excel|apple_excel (see the L</DESCRIPTION> for details)

B<Returns:> Nothing

=back

=head3 parse_datetime( @arg_list )

=over

B<Definition:> This is how positive excel numbers are translated to L<DateTime> objects

B<Accepts:> @arg_list - the order is important!

=over

B<0. > $the_excel_number_for_translation - must be positive - no strings allowed

B<1. > 'time_zone' (the only useful option - other values here will ignore position 2)

B<2. > A recognizable time zone string or L<DateTime::TimeZone> object

B<example: > ( 12345, time_zone => 'America/Los_Angeles' )

=back

B<Returns:> A DateTime object set to match the passed values.  A floating time zone is default.

=back

=head3 format_datetime( $date_time )

=over

B<Definition:> This is how DateTime objects can be translated to Excel epoch numbers

B<Accepts:> A L<DateTime> object

B<Returns:> An excel epoch number or DateTime object if it is before the relevant epoch start.

=head1 Build/Install from Source
	
B<1.> Download a compressed file with the code
	
B<2.> Extract the code from the compressed file.  If you are using tar this should work:

        tar -zxvf DateTimeX-Format-Excel-v1.xx.tar.gz

B<4.> Run the following commands

=over

(For Windows find what version of make was used to compile your perl)

	perl  -V:make

(then for Windows substitute the correct make function (s/make/dmake/g)?)
